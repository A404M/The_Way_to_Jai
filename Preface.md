# Preface - Goals of this Jai tutorial.

This tutorial is meant to help people hit the ground running when the language is released.  
That's why it is called **"The Way to Jai"**. While this will not be so useful at this moment (Aug 2022), at some point in time it will be.

The [Jai Community Library Wiki](https://github.com/Jai-Community/Jai-Community-Library/wiki) does an excellent job in providing many details about the Jai language, and a lot of useful code snippets.
However the wiki intentionally addresses more experienced developers.

This tutorial on the other hand is intended for beginning programmers who want to learn this fascinating and promising language. We will try to explain from the ground up how Jai is constructed and how it works, with an emphasis on insight and best practices. At the same time, parallel guides with more in-depth information will also be provided, but they are not needed to learn basic Jai programming.

The material is divided into numbered chapters **1_**, **2_**, and so on; **2B_** , **2C_** is the numbering for the more detailed info belonging to chapter 2. The chapters are small, so you can easily work through each of them in 15-30 min. Each chapter has a subfolder _code_  with working code examples, and in most cases also a subfolder _exercises_, containing solutions to questions / exercises in the text. Code examples are also numbered like **2.1_**, **2.2_**, and so on, and each contains a complete working program, showing only one discussed item each. This results in a great number of small examples, but enhances the learning experience.

Within code listings, important code lines will be indicates with **// 1**, **// 2** and so on, after the code. These numbers are referred to in the text discussion. Any output of a program will be shown in the text as well as in the snippet itself, after a **// =>** in the code line itself or on the following line if needed. If the output is too big, it will be shown within /*  */ after the last code line.

Here are some conventions we'll use in the text:

```
Code will be shown in a grey background.
```

We'll use _italics_ for folder names, module names, other packages, and so on.

We'll use **bold** for new keywords and directives.

Sometimes comparisons will be made with other programming languages, to better engage experienced developers, but these will be outside the main text.

We'll take great care in introducing every new concept step by step, and we will maintain a strict rule of not using anything in code examples which hasn't been discussed yet. This will also result in many examples like: "this thing can also be used in this way, or together with this other thing", but again we believe that this eases the learning curve.
If we need to mention something which has not been explained yet, we'll add a forward reference to where it is discussed.

Also for those of you who are beginning their programming journey, do speak out code internally when reading a program, explain to yourself all that happens in the code. 
Later on this becomes more automatic, but in beginning stages it is very helpful to not be overwhelmed by code which seems more complex at first.
 

I would like to express my sincere admiration to **Jonathan Blow** for creating this superb language. Welcome to the wonderful world of developing in Jai!
