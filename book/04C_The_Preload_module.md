# 4C - The Preload module
We already talked about the Basic module, which is necessary for printing. But there is also a _Preload_ module, which is even more fundamental and is implicitly loaded whenever the Jai compiler is started, so it doesnâ€™t need to be imported.
It contains the minimal definitions the compiler needs in order to compile user source code.

It contains enums for the _Operating_System_, the _Type_Info_ definitions, the definitions for _Allocator, Logger, Stack trace, Context, Temporary Storage, Source Code location, Array_View and Resizable_Array_.   
It also contains very low-level functions or **intrinsics** which closely mimic corresponding C functions, like the following.

   	memcpy :: (dest: *void, source: *void, count: s64) #intrinsic;
	memcmp :: (a: *void, b: *void, count: s64) -> s16  #intrinsic;
	memset :: (dest: *void, value: u8, count: s64)     #intrinsic;
   
**memcpy** copies count bytes from source to dest, see line (1).   
**memcmp** compares the first count bytes of a and b, its return value is < 0 when a is less than b, > 0 when a is greater than b and 0 when a is equal to b.    
**memset** sets count bytes of dest to value.  

> Notice the #intrinsic directive with which these functions are marked.

For some example code, See *4.2_intrinsics.jai*:
```c++
#import "Basic";

main :: () {
    x: int = 42;
    y: type_of(x);

    memcpy(*y, *x, size_of(type_of(x)));    // (1)
    print("y is %\n", y);  // => y is 42; 
}
```
