# Chapter 16 - Types in depth

At compile time Jai deduces all there is to know about the types of all variables and objects.  
(To see how type inference works in depth, read the masterfully written 090_how_typechecking_works article in the how_to/ folder of the compiler.) This info is heavily used in meta-programming at compile-time, and it is even (partially ??) known at run-time.
In this chapter we'll see which data-structures from built-in modules are used for this processing. 

## 16.1 Type_Info and Type_Info_Tag

## 16.2 Definition of Any
