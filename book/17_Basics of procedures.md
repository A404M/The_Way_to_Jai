# Chapter 17 - Basics of procedures

We know that we can create local code blocks (see 7.1.2), and that we can repeat a code block with in a or for loop. But it is also very useful to be able to call a code block by name, which is exactly what a **procedure** or **proc** (more often called **functions** in other languages) is.  
Until now we've only used the main :: () proc.
