# 23 Polymorphic arrays and structs

Much like we did in ยง 22 to make the types of function arguments and return values generic, we can also do something similar for arrays and structs.

## 23.1 Polymorphic arrays
In ยง 22 we already used arguments of a generic array type [] $T. 
The following example shows that this can also be done for the size of the array with something like [$N]:  
`x: [$N] $T`

See _23.1_array_polymorph.jai_:
```c++
#import "Basic";

describe_array :: (x: [$N] $T) {                // (1)
    print("An array of % items of type %\n", N, T);
}

main :: () {
    x := int.[1,2,3,4];
    describe_array(x); // => An array of 4 items of type s64
}
```

Of course, $T can be replaced by a type like int, so that a parameter is only used for the size.

## 23.2 A more general map procedure
We can use this to generalize our earlier map example 22.7_map.jai:  
`map :: (array_a: [$N] $T, f: (T)-> T ) -> [N] T`

See _23.2_map2.jai_:
```c++
#import "Basic";

map :: (array_a: [$N] $T, f: (T)-> T ) -> [N] T {
  array_b: [N]T;
  for i: 0..N-1 {
    array_b[i] = f(array_a[i]);
  }
  return array_b;
}

main :: () {
  array_a := int.[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8];
  array_b := map(array_a, (x) => x + 100); 
  print("array_b is %\n", array_b);
  // => array_b is [101, 102, 103, 104, 105, 106, 107, 108]
}
```

This way we get the size passed as a generic parameter. If the applied lambda doesn't change the type T of the items, we can replace R by T as well.


## 23.3 Polymorphic structs
We can also use generic parameters to pass to a struct, in this case to define a 2D array as a struct field:

See _23.3_poly_struct.jai_:
```c++
import "Basic";

TwoD :: struct (M: int, N: int) {           // (1)
  array: [M][N] int;
}

TwoDb :: #bake_arguments TwoD(M = 5);       // (2)

main :: () {
  twod: TwoDb(N = 2);                        // (3)
  print("twod is %\n", twod);                // (4) 
  // => twod is {[[0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0], [0, 0]]}
  print("its dimensions are (%, %)\n", twod.M, twod.N);  // (5) 
  // => its dimensions are (5, 2)
}

```

The struct is defined in line (1). In line (2) we use #bake_arguments to bake in one of the dimensions. In line (3) the other dimension is passed when declaring a struct twod.
Line (4) shows the initial struct. Line (5) shows that we can access the passed parameters on the struct variable's name.
