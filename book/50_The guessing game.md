# 50 The guessing game

This is a console game. The program randomly chooses a number lower than a certain maximum (say 100). The player inputs an integer between 0 and 100. The program tells if the number is too low or too high, and when you have guessed the right number in how many steps.  
Here is an example of the interaction between program and player:  
`ivo@DESKTOP-KN14QQK:~/jai_projects$ ./guessing_game
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 75
75 is too high
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 63
63 is too high
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 52
52 is too high
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 42
42 is too low
Guess a number between 1 and 100: 47
47 is the answer!
Finished in 5 guesses
Total input errors: 0

The current version works only on Linux: it imports the _POSIX_ module for the `read` function in procedure `read_line` (which uses the `libdl` library).

See _50.1_guessing_game.jai_:
```c++

First we need to pick a random number, for which we use the technique laid out in ยง 6B.2  
`pick_answer` determines the `answer` the player should guess. It uses `random_get`, which uses the random seed from the line before.

The game data are stored in a struct instance game of type Game (defined in (1)). This is populated with data in lines (2) and following, and the game starts in (3):  
`play(*game);`

This consists of the following steps:  
(1) `ask_guess_multi`  
    --> (1.1) `ask_guess`
        --> (1.1.1) `read_line`

                This reads in a string, which must be converted to an integer before returning as the `guess`.
                It does this by calling the proc `read` from module _POSIX_, which reads input from stdin and stores it in a `buffer`. This is converted to a string with `to_string`.

(2) `report`
    This compares the guess with the answer, and prints the guess and the response from the game.

(3) `update`
    Here the Game state is updated: the number of guesses is incremented and `done` is set to true when guess == answer.

When done == true, this stops the while loop in play:
`while !game.done`
and line (3) returns. This prints "Finished in ", the number of guesses and eventual errors and stops the game.
