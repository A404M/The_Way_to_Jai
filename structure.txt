bool in conditions:
If var is a non-zero value, it tests as true in conditions, and !var is equal to false.

if n % 2 == 0   print("n is an even number");
if (n & 1) == 0 // this is true for n with even value

Date type ?

LATER:
- Debugging: after control structures
- 9.3 before 9.1 ?
- Type_Info: after struct, enum , see types.jai in 11_Advanced examples
